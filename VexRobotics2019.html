                <h2>Project Details</h2>
                <p>The Vex Robotics Competition is a worldwide, yearly challenge that tasks
                    teams to build and program a robot to complete tasks. The 2018-19 game consists
                    of multiple game components and complex tasks that required careful planning and
                    lots of thought.</p>
                <p>After huge amounts of work this year we successfully managed to qualify for
                    the world championships by winning the national competition!</p>

                <h2>Our Robot</h2>
                <p>My teams robot was designed specifically around firing balls at the flags. We
                    decided this would be the best idea due to the points that we would be able to
                    score. We ended up creating a flywheel that allowed us to reliably fire the
                    balls quickly and efficiently. We also managed to implement a “cap flipping” arm
                    that allowed us to turn over the plastic disks onto our team colour.
                </p>
                <h2>Awards</h2>
                <p>During the competitions we went to we managed to win multiple awards:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tournament Champion - Won for beating all of the opposition at a regional
                        competition</li>
                    <li>Division Champion - Won for beating all of the other teams in our division
                        at the nationals.</li>
                    <li>Think Award - Won for excellent programming skills.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Currently we are working towards raising money to the world championships in
                    Kentucky, USA in April. If you would like to donate to our cause,
