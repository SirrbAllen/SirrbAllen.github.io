                <h2>Project Details</h2>
                <p>This was a project for the Sheffield Children's Hospital. The aim was to create a game that would encourage people to be active whilst raising awareness for their Golden Hour Campaign to raise money for a helipad.</p>
                <p>The aim of the game is to walk around the Olympic Legacy Park in Sheffield to different points of interest. Then, in augmented reality, the hospital's mascot appears on screen doing various exercises.</p>
                <p>Here is a link to the app on the App Store and Gooogle Play Store:</p>

                <h2>The Game</h2>
                <p>The game was built using Unity game engine and used C# as the main language. My main roll was to create the onscreen assets for the game and to help with some of the backend processing.</p>
                <p>We worked with some fairly large companies and charities for this project such as MoveMore, AMRC, and the Olympic Legacy Park.</p>
