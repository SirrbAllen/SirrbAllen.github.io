                <h2>Project Details</h2>
                <p>The Vex Robotics Competition is a worldwide, yearly challenge that tasks
                    teams to build and program a robot to complete tasks. The 2017-18 game consists
                    of cones that must be stacked on 'mobile goals' which must then be moved into goal zones.</p>
                <p>This was the first time I took part in this competition and me and my team was sucessful in qualifying for the national championships!</p>
                <p>The official video detailing the 2017-18 game:

                <h2>Our Robot</h2>
                <p>The robot this year was designed to pickup and stack cones. The idea is to take the cones and place them on top of mobile goals. Then, using a mechanism similar to a forklift truck, it lifts these mobile goals and places them in scoring zones.
